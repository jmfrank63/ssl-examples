# ssl-examples
A few examples using ssl connections with logged session keys.

## Warning These examples use a non merged pull request on a development version of python

To install the 3.8.0 development version of python and use

https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/10031

Additionally you need to compile against openssl version 1.1.1

The examples should then all be working.

You can use the logged session keys to decrypt packet traces, for example with Wireshark
